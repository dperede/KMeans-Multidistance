# KMeans-Multidistance

The traditional implementation of K-Means algorithm is usually considering only the euclidean distance to compute the distance between the points in the feature space. This new libary is an implementation of the K-Means algorithm with multiple distances choices:
* Euclidean Distance
* Cosine Distance
* City-Block Distance
* L1 Distance
* L2 Distance
* Manhattan Distance
* Bray-Curtis Distance 
* Canberra Distance
* Chebysev Distance
* Correlation Distance 
* Mahalanobis Distance
* Seuclidean Distance
* Sqeuclidean Distance


# Usage

In order to install the library, use pip:

```bash
pip install kmeans_multidistance
```
To see an introduction to using the library, please check the demo notebook [Demo Notebook](Demo.ipynb)
